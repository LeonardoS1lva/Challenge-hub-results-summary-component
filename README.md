## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

In this project, I learned how to structure and style a results summary component. I practiced using CSS custom properties for managing reusable styles. Additionally, I gained experience in building responsive designs with a mobile-first approach.

### Continued development

For future projects, I want to further enhance my skills in React and explore additional front-end frameworks like Next.js. I also plan to dive deeper into advanced CSS techniques, such as CSS animations and transitions, to add more interactivity to my projects.

### Useful resources

During the development of this project, I found the following resources helpful:

- [Mozilla Developer Network (MDN)](https://developer.mozilla.org): A comprehensive web development resource that provides detailed documentation and guides on HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
- [CSS-Tricks](https://css-tricks.com): A web design and development blog that covers various CSS topics, including flexbox, grid, and responsive design.
- [Styled Components Documentation](https://styled-components.com/docs): The official documentation for Styled Components, which provided valuable information on how to style components in a React project using CSS-in-JS.
